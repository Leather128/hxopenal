# audio-position-shifting

This is a demo of the library that plays one wav file and changes the position of the playback to sound like it's in a different position (most effective on headphones). The code that does the position shifting can be found in both Main.hx and Sound.hx (using the sound abstraction system from [basic-audio-playback](https://github.com/Leather128/hxopenal/tree/main/demo/basic-audio-playback)).

## Usage

This demo should be used to demonstrate how to change the position of audio, and how it sounds when changed in playback.

## Building

To build, first run `haxe build.hxml` in this folder, then run the application to hear the sound playing. Make sure to run the program from the bin folder or else it will not load the audio correctly.
